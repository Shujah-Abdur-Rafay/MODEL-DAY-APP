# üöÄ Model Day - Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Model Day Flutter application to Vercel successfully.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ Flutter SDK installed (>=3.2.3)
- ‚úÖ Git repository set up
- ‚úÖ Vercel account created
- ‚úÖ Firebase project configured

## üîß Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Firebase Configuration

Ensure your Firebase configuration is properly set up:

```dart
// lib/firebase_options.dart should contain your Firebase config
// Make sure all required services are enabled:
// - Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-in)
// - Firestore Database
// - Storage (if using file uploads)
```

### 2. Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may need to set environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add any required variables (if applicable)

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Connect GitHub to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Shujah-Abdur-Rafay/MODEL-DAY`

2. **Configure Project**:
   - Framework Preset: `Other`
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave as default)
   - Build Command: `flutter build web --release --base-href=/`
   - Output Directory: `build/web`
   - Install Command: `flutter pub get`

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app
   - Every push to main branch will trigger a new deployment

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   # Use the provided script
   ./deploy.sh  # On Unix/Mac
   # OR
   deploy.bat   # On Windows
   
   # OR manually:
   flutter pub get
   flutter build web --release --base-href=/
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

### vercel.json
The project includes an optimized `vercel.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "pubspec.yaml",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "build/web"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    // Optimized routing for Flutter web assets
  ],
  "buildCommand": "flutter build web --release --base-href=/",
  "installCommand": "flutter pub get"
}
```

### .vercelignore
Excludes unnecessary files from deployment to optimize build times.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Fails**:
   ```bash
   # Clear Flutter cache and rebuild
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Assets Not Loading**:
   - Ensure `--base-href=/` is used in build command
   - Check that asset paths in `pubspec.yaml` are correct

3. **Firebase Connection Issues**:
   - Verify Firebase configuration in `lib/firebase_options.dart`
   - Ensure Firebase project has correct domain settings
   - Add your Vercel domain to Firebase authorized domains

4. **Routing Issues**:
   - The `vercel.json` includes proper SPA routing configuration
   - All routes should redirect to `index.html`

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Compression**:
   - Vercel automatically enables gzip compression
   - The configuration includes proper headers for optimization

2. **Caching**:
   - Static assets are automatically cached by Vercel
   - Flutter web builds include proper cache headers

## üì± Post-Deployment

### 1. Test Your Application

After deployment, test these key features:
- ‚úÖ User authentication (login/signup)
- ‚úÖ Navigation between pages
- ‚úÖ Event creation and management
- ‚úÖ Data persistence
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ File uploads (if applicable)

### 2. Custom Domain (Optional)

To add a custom domain:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS settings as instructed

### 3. Analytics and Monitoring

Consider adding:
- Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- User analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
